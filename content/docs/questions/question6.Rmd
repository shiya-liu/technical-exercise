# How do their students, in their academic plans, perform compared to students from other departments/colleges?

## Set up and load data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment='', warning = FALSE)
```

```{r }

library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, ggplot2, broom, mice, kableExtra, data.table, ggrepel)

## Research question
**How do their students, in their academic plans, perform compared to students from other departments/colleges?**

To compare students in those three academic plans (Physics, Biology (Human Anatomy), and Spanish) with others, I combine all data sets.
Then, I select academic plan from **acad_plan** data set and put student into two groups in the overall data set. 
Next, I compare those groups based on plot and welch test.


## Data cleaning
1. Combine all data sets and drop observations without official grades
2. Select academic plan from **acad_plan** data set
3. Put student into two groups based on their academic plan
```{r collapse=TRUE}
DF <- course_enrollments %>% 
  left_join(class_inventory, by = c("term_code","class_nbr")) %>%
  full_join(class_instructors, by = c("term_code", "class_nbr")) %>%
  full_join(acad_plan, c("acad_plan","dept_code")) %>%
  full_join(student_details, by = "student_id_number")
```

```{r collapse=TRUE}
cols_factor <- c("acad_plan","subject","acad_career","degree","college","eff_status","official_grade")
DF <- as.data.table(DF)
DF[,c(cols_factor) := lapply(.SD,as.factor), .SDcols = cols_factor]
```

```{r}
summary(DF)

DF <- DF%>%
  filter(!is.na(official_grade))
```
Notice that there are some rows in the data set with NA values for acad_career, degree, college, etc. However, since we want to focus on comparing success rates between three academic plans and others, we can ignore those missing values.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
plan <- acad_plan %>% 
  filter(acad_plan_desc %in% c("Bios Human Biology","Physics","Spanish")) 
DF <- DF %>%
  mutate(
    treat = case_when(
      acad_plan %in% plan$acad_plan~ "Y",
      is.na(acad_plan) ~ NA_character_,
      TRUE ~ "N"
    )
  )
DF$treat <- as.factor(DF$treat)
```

  ggplot(aes(x = treat, y = percent, fill = treat)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(0.5), stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = percent), size = 6, vjust = -.8) +

        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", vjust = 0.9, size = 16),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", vjust = 0.9, size = 16),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "black", size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 20)
  ) 
```

The plot shows that success rates of student in those three academic plans (Physics, Biology (Human Anatomy), and Spanish) are different with others. To have strong evidence, I conduct Welch test to compare those groups.

## Welch test

```{r}
compare <- DF %>%
  select(c("success", "treat")) %>%
  drop_na()
compare$success <- as.numeric(compare$success)
oneway.test(success~treat, data = compare,var.equal=FALSE)
```

## Conclusion
While the plot indicates success rates of those two groups are different, the Welch test shows that those difference are not statistically significant.
