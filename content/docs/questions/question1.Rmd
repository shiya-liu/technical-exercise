# What are our overall success rates (C or better)?

## Set up and load data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment='')
```

```{r message=FALSE}
rm(list =ls())
library(tidyverse)
load("D:/R/data analysis/Institutional research/technical-exercise/content/docs/data_230220_2216.Rdata")
```

## Research question

**What are our overall success rates (C or better)?**
In this question, success refers to students who get C or better in their grades.
**official_grade** variable in **course_erollments** data set provides information of student success, which can be used to evaluate overall success rates.


## Data cleaning

To analyze overall success rates, I first transform the students' **official_grade** variable to the **success** variable. If students obtained C or better grade, the **success** variable is recorded as Y. Otherwise, this variable is N.

```{r comment=''}
success <- course_enrollments %>%
 mutate(success = case_when(
   official_grade %in% c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C") ~ "Y",
   TRUE ~ "N")) %>%
  count(success) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100*n/sum(n),2)) %>%
  select(-n)
```

## Visualization
Let's visualize their success rates.

```{r}
p <- success %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = success, y = percent, fill = success)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(0.5), stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = percent), size = 6, vjust = -.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#56B4E9", "#E69F00")) +
  labs(
    x = "Success",
    y = "Percent (%)",
    title = "What are our overall success rates (C or better)?"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", vjust = 0.9, size = 18),
    axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", vjust = 0.9, size = 18),
    axis.text = element_text(colour = "black", size = 16),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 28)
  ) 
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggsave('p.png', width = 12, height = 8, plot = p)
```

## Conclusion

The overall success rates is 59.84%.
