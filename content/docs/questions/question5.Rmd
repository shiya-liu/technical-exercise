## Research question

**Does teaching frequently the course improve instructor performance over time?**

This question requires to explore whether instructor teach more frequent, their performance will improve. In other words, it examines relationships between number of terms they teach and success rates. The data set **class_instructors** has information related to instructor and courses they teach. The data set **course_enrollments** has information about students' success rates. Next, I combine those two data sets and conduct further analysis.

## Data  cleaning
1. Join two data sets: **class_instructors** and **course_enrollments** via term_code and class_nbr variables (drop the observations without grades)
2. Calculate how many terms per instructor teach
3. Calculate how many courses they teach 

```{r}
instructor <- course_enrollments %>%
  left_join(
    class_instructors, 
    by = c("term_code","class_nbr")
    )

term <- instructor %>%
  group_by(instructor_id_number) %>%
  summarise(
    total_student = n(),
    freq = sum(success == "Y"),
    percent = freq/total_student,
    total_term = n_distinct(term_code),
    total_course = n_distinct(class_nbr)
  ) %>%
  filter(total_term <= 6)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(term)
```

The relationship between frequency of teaching and performance does not show the linear trend. That is to say, teaching frequently does not guarantee better performance. Instead, there are two tipping points. From the boxplot, if the instructor teaches less than six terms, the performance seems improve. However, for instructors who teach six terms, their performance lower than others.

## Statistical test
```{r}
oneway.test(percent~total_term, data = term,var.equal=FALSE)
```
Overall, Welch test does not show there is statistically significant difference of number of terms instructors teach. It might caused by the performance of those who teach six terms decreases. 
I conduct a simple linear regression to see whether the total terms are associated with performance.


```{r}
reg <- lm(percent~total_term + total_student + total_course, data = term)
broom::tidy(reg) %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("basic", bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```
P value of total_term is less than 0.05. That is to say, the number of terms instructors teach is related to their performance. Therefore, based on the previous findings, I select instructors who teach less than six terms and to see whether there is difference.
Moreover, the number of courses they teach is also statistically significant related to their performance.

### Further exploration

```{r}
term5 <- term %>%
  filter(total_term < 6)
```

```{r}
oneway.test(percent~total_term, data = term5,var.equal=FALSE)
```
Welch test still does not significant. 


## Conclusion
While the boxplot show a slight difference among instructors who teach different number of terms, the statistic tests indicate that those difference are not significant.
